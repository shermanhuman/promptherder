# Hard Rules

Project-level rules that are always active. Added by `/rule` or manually.

- All user decision points must use markdown blockquotes (`>`) for visual consistency. Any time the user needs to choose an action, present the options in a `>` blockquote.
- When referencing any concept that has a short name, lead with the short name in backticks followed by a brief description. Example: `edges` — boundary conditions and error handling. This teaches users the vocabulary progressively.
