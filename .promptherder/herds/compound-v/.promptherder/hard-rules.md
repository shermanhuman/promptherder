# Hard Rules

Project-level rules that are always active. Added by `/rule` or manually.

## Formatting

- Block quotes are for prompting the user — questions, decisions, and action menus. Do not use block quotes for informational text or instructions.
- Ordered lists for sequential steps. Unordered lists when order doesn't matter.
- **Bold** for key terms and action verbs in steps.
- `Inline code` for anything the user might copy: commands, paths, filenames, flags, slugs.
- _Italic_ for caveats, assumptions, and de-emphasized metadata.
