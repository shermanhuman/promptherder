| 1   | JSON settings file at `.promptherder/settings.json`                              | accepted | Consistent with `manifest.json` and `herd.json` formats already in the project; stdlib `encoding/json` — no new deps; git-friendly | YAML would be more human-readable                                                                                    | JSON is the established format in this project. Settings file is small enough that JSON is fine.                                                   |
| 2   | TOML/YAML settings file                                                          | rejected | More human-readable for hand-editing                                                                                               | Adds a dependency (go-toml or go-yaml); inconsistent with existing JSON convention                                   | Not worth adding a dependency for a 5-field config file                                                                                            |
| 3   | `promptherder init` command to create settings                                   | rejected | Interactive setup is nice                                                                                                          | YAGNI — users can copy an example or hand-create; adds CLI surface area                                              | The file is trivial to create manually. Document the format and provide a sensible default.                                                        |
| 4   | Workflow prefix: rename output filenames in both Antigravity and Copilot targets | accepted | Namespaces workflows to avoid collisions; user-configurable                                                                        | Slightly more complex filename logic                                                                                 | Core ask. The prefix applies to the _output_ filename, not the source.                                                                             |
| 5   | Auto-commit after artifact writes                                                | accepted | Convenient for CI and clean git history                                                                                            | Some users don't want auto-commits                                                                                   | Default off, opt-in via `auto_commit: true`. Uses `git add` + `git commit` on the managed files only.                                              |
| 6   | Use `os/exec` for git commit                                                     | accepted | Simple, reliable                                                                                                                   | Requires git binary on PATH                                                                                          | Git is already required for workflow — promptherder is a git-centric tool. Keep it minimal: `git add <files>; git commit -m "promptherder: sync"`. |
| 7   | Prefix applies to skills too, not just workflows                                 | rejected | Consistency                                                                                                                        | Skills already have unique names (e.g. `compound-v-tdd`); prefixing would be redundant and break existing references | Prefix only affects workflow/prompt names                                                                                                          |
| 8   | Fall back to defaults when settings.json is missing                              | accepted | Zero-config remains the default; existing repos just work                                                                          | None                                                                                                                 | Must be fully backward compatible                                                                                                                  |
