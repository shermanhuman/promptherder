# Decisions: hard-rules

| #   | Idea                                                            | Verdict  | Pros                                                                    | Cons                                                              | Rationale                                                                                                 |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Per-repo `.promptherder/rules.md` file                          | accepted | Simple, lives next to other promptherder config, single source of truth | Another file to manage                                            | Users already know `.promptherder/` as the config root. One file is simpler than a directory of rules.    |
| 2   | Directory of individual rule files (`.promptherder/rules/*.md`) | rejected | More modular, one concern per file                                      | Over-engineering for user rules, herds already provide modularity | Herds handle modular rules. User hard-rules should be a single concise file — YAGNI.                      |
| 3   | Use existing `MEMORY` block in agent settings                   | rejected | Built-in to Antigravity                                                 | Platform-specific, not portable, managed outside promptherder     | promptherder should own its own config. MEMORY blocks are Antigravity-specific.                           |
| 4   | Name it "rules.md"                                              | accepted | Clear, matches existing `rules/` convention from herds                  | Could confuse with herd rules dir                                 | Context makes it clear: `.promptherder/rules.md` = your rules, `.promptherder/agent/rules/` = herd rules. |
| 5   | `/rule` workflow to append rules                                | accepted | Lightweight like `/idea`, lowers friction to add rules                  | Could be done manually                                            | Consistency with `/idea` pattern. One command to append.                                                  |
| 6   | Merge rules.md into targets during install                      | accepted | Makes rules available to all agents automatically                       | Adds merge logic                                                  | Small, well-scoped change to the install targets.                                                         |
| 7   | Name it "conventions.md" or "standards.md"                      | rejected | More descriptive                                                        | Less intuitive, longer                                            | "rules" is the established term in the herd system.                                                       |
