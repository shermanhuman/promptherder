# Brainstorm Skill

## When to use this skill

- before implementing non-trivial features
- before refactors with unclear scope
- before debugging complex issues
- before designing an automation workflow

## Research first

Before generating options, search for context in parallel:

- `search_web` for current alternatives, libraries, or approaches to the problem.
- `search_web` for known pitfalls or anti-patterns in the domain.
- Read relevant project files to understand what exists today.

## Brainstorm template (use this exact structure)

### Goal

- (1–2 sentences)

### Constraints

- (tech stack, time, compatibility, performance, "must not change", etc.)

### Known context

- (what exists today; relevant files/components; current behavior)

### Risks

- (security, data loss, regressions, surprising side effects)

### Options (2–4)

For each option include:

- Summary
- Pros / cons
- Complexity / risk

### Recommendation

- Pick one option and explain why

### Acceptance criteria

- Bullet list of verifiable outcomes
