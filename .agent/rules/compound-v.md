# Compound V

You have the Compound V methodology available. Use these workflows and skills:

## Pipeline

1. `/plan` — autonomous planning with approval gate
2. `/execute` — parallel-by-default execution with checkpointing
3. `/review` — severity-graded review pass
4. `/idea` — add to future tasks (lightweight, any time)

## Skills (auto-activated)

- `compound-v-plan` — autonomous planning methodology
- `compound-v-review` — review checklist
- `compound-v-tdd` — tests-first discipline
- `compound-v-debug` — systematic debugging
- `compound-v-parallel` — parallel execution reasoning
- `compound-v-verify` — verification before completion

## Manual rules

- `@browser.md` — browser-based UI testing
